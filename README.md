Stock Trading Simulation 

## Project Description
Created using Codeblocks 13.12\

This project was part of our lessons on inheritance.

The trading simulation uses data files which store the stock prices of a particular company over time.
The data is read in and processed as a 'bar' which is used by the trading strategy to determine which course of action to take.
Since all strategies share similair member variables and methods, the trading_stategy class was utilized as a base class in their implementations.
